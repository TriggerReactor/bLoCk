# What is bLoCk?
bLoCk is a website for generating Trigger Reactor code through Block-Coding based on Google's Blockly library.<br>
L and C mean Look and Create. It literally means you can Create amazing TriggerReactor code as soon as you Look at the bLoCk!
You can use the service right now on [Here](https://abc.xyz)<br>
# Why bLoCk?
If you use bLoCk, **There's no need that you learn how to write TriggerReactor code!** Because it generates TriggerReactor code directly from 'Blocks' which are well-explained on itself.
# I cannot see any source code here. Why?
This repository is only for receiving issue of bLoCk Project. Because the developer of this service does not want to open source code to the public(because it is *DIRTY CODE*), the source code is not uploaded on this repository.
# Why is the code highlighting on bLoCk not perfect?
Sorry.
